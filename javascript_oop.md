## Data Types

* JavaScript uses two kinds of types: primitive and reference. Primitive types are stored as simple data types. Reference types are stored as objects, which are really just references to locations in memory. The tricky thing is that JavaScript lets you treat primitive types like reference types in order to make the language more consistent for the developer.
* 5 primitive types in JavaScript:
  1. Boolean
  2. Number (int or float)
  3. String (string or char)
  4. Null
  5. Undefined
